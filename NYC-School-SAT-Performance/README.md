# Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores 🏫

<br>

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyses **New York City public school SAT performance** to uncover insights into student achievement across schools and boroughs.  
Each SAT section — **Reading**, **Math**, and **Writing** — has a *maximum score of 800 points*.  

The analysis identifies top-performing schools in math, the overall best schools by combined SAT scores, and the borough with the greatest score variation — offering valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and parents.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Best Math Schools: Schools with math averages ≥ 80% of the maximum possible score (≥ 640).
- Top 10 Schools Overall: Based on combined SAT totals (Math + Reading + Writing).
- Borough Variability: The borough with the largest standard deviation in total SAT scores shows the widest range in school performance.

Example outputs include:  
- `best_math_schools`: 12 schools with average math scores ≥ 640  
- `top_10_schools`: Top performers led by **Stuyvesant High School** and **Bronx High School of Science**
