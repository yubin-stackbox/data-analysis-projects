## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates crime data from Los Angeles to uncover **when, where, and what types of crimes** occur most frequently.  
By exploring patterns in time (day vs. night, weekday vs. weekend) and location (neighborhood hotspots), the analysis helps identify crime trends that can inform smarter policing and community safety strategies.
